        <b>No Data Collection:</b> At Talent Integrity, we’re in the business of exposing unethical practices—not committing them.
        That’s why we do <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from visitors. No names, no emails, no digital
        imprints collected. Browse freely; your privacy is safe here.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Our Mission is to Educate:</b> We focus on raising awareness about online exam cheating, proxy hiring, and integrity issues
        in assessments or exams, etc. The content we share—whether it’s case studies, articles, or videos—is meant to inform and educate only.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Analytics &amp; Pixels for Insights:</b> We use basic web analytics tools and tracking pixels to understand how our content is performing,
        what’s being read, where users drop off, and which topics spark the most interest. This helps us improve the site and make our mission more impactful.
        These tools do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information, and we use them solely for content optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Retargeting with Purpose (Not Personal Data):</b> While we don’t collect personal information on this site, we may use external channels to
        <strong> retarget users who’ve shown interest in integrity topics</strong>. This is done through platform-level tools (not tied to your identity on our site)
        to keep you informed about new risks, real-world cases, and emerging trends in exam and hiring fraud.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Information Shared is One-Way Only:</b> While we talk about cheating techniques (like remote proctoring exploits, impersonation, or AI-assisted fraud, etc.),
        this is strictly for <strong>educational and preventive purposes</strong>. We do not encourage, promote, or facilitate unethical behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Contact (Optional, Not Required):</b> Should you wish to reach us for feedback, collaboration, or a really juicy cheating case study,
        you can do so via our [Contact page/email]. But even then, your message is your choice—we won’t collect anything unless you send it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Policy Updates:</b> If we ever add features like newsletters or downloadable resources, we’ll update this policy clearly and openly.
        You’ll always know exactly what we’re doing—and more importantly, what we’re not.
